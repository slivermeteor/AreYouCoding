Because of some exams, I don't have enough time to update this project.But now, I'm coming back.In this update, I use DataGrid control to replace ListView control in order to achiece the
function of correct the running time in the list.At now, I have not complete this function, but, at the next time, I will push it.
Second, I have separate code into different file.Each file's code's function is writed in the top of file.I hope this will help everyone to more easy to
understand the project.
Third, I fix some bugs what almost about monitorring threading.
Last, I have transfer old commit node to the file 'UpdateData.txt'.If you want to know the old update note, please to read it.



## Introduce
This project is written by C#, perhaps i will add dll written by C++ to the project in the future.
This projrct's boundary is use the WPF.

## Target 
Now, this project is still very poor.It's boundary is still very simple and crude, because I'm not good at WPF or C#. but I'm studying.In my opinion, 
the C# is a very intertesting programming language.I wish to code this project to improve my C#.

## Functions
1.The main window will monitor any process you want to, and recoed it's start time and end time.Show you the process run time if you want.

## Bugs
Now, all the functions seem work perfectly.

## What i will do
1.I will perfect "Detail dynamics"  label as soon as possible.
