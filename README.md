# Welcome to use AreYouCoding - Count you the time of use any software that you want to count

## Introduce
This project is written by C#, perhaps i will add dll written by C++ to the project in the future.
This projrct's boundary is use the WPF.

## Target 
Now, this project is still very poor.It's boundary is still very simple and crude, because I'm not good at WPF or C#. but I'm studying.In my opinion, 
the C# is a very intertesting programming language.I wish to code this project to improve my C#.

## Functions
1.The main window will monitor any process you want to, and recoed it's start time and end time.Show you the process run time if you want.

## Bugs
1.If there is more than two process have a same name, main window will only monitor the first start process, and recoed the end time of the last exit process.

## What i will do
1.I will perfect "Detail dynamics"  label as soon as possible.
2.I wiil fix the the bug of that can't monitor processes of the same name.
