# Welcome to use AreYouCoding - Count you the time of use any software that you want to count

# 2016-12-2 Commit Note
I change the MainWindow's closing message. At the first time, User can choose click the close button to exit process or just minimize the mainwindow.
At the same time, I add two radiobutton into setting tableitem.User can also set what to do when close the mainwindow.

# What I will do    
1.I will perfect "Detail dynamics"  label as soon as possible.This time, I will suit the action to the word!!! :)   
2.Make the front of StatusBar to show some useful imformation.   
3.I hope the AreYouCoding will show everyuser the situation of monitor at the a specfice day.   
4.I will modify the close button to minimize the Window.

# Introduce
This project is written by C#, perhaps i will add dll written by C++ to the project in the future.
This projrct's boundary is use the WPF.

# Target 
Now, this project is still very poor.It's boundary is still very simple and crude, because I'm not good at WPF or C#. but I'm studying.In my opinion, 
the C# is a very intertesting programming language.I wish to code this project to improve my C#.

# Functions
1.The main window will monitor any process you want to, and recoed it's start time and end time.Show you the process run time if you want.

# Bugs
Now, all the functions seem work perfectly.
