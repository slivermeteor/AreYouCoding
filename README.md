Today, I start to perfect the "detail situation" label.I want to add ToolBar and TopMenu to it.First of all, I need to leant how to use them.So it may be a long time to see I complete it.
To be honest, perfecting the "detail dynamics" is more important.If I come across too many problems in learnning use the two Controls, I may first do this.

I have distinguish different process in the listview.So you can look these process's run time that have the same name.
Next time, I will perfect the "detail dynamics" labe.I will make it can show the recent monitor process run time situation in it.
Meanwhile, I may adjust the "detail situation" label, but I don't have a specific idea about it.So you can have a expect about it.

## Introduce
This project is written by C#, perhaps i will add dll written by C++ to the project in the future.
This projrct's boundary is use the WPF.

## Target 
Now, this project is still very poor.It's boundary is still very simple and crude, because I'm not good at WPF or C#. but I'm studying.In my opinion, 
the C# is a very intertesting programming language.I wish to code this project to improve my C#.

## Functions
1.The main window will monitor any process you want to, and recoed it's start time and end time.Show you the process run time if you want.

## Bugs
Now, all the functions seem work perfectly.

## What i will do
1.I will perfect "Detail dynamics"  label as soon as possible.
