function of correct the running time in the list.At now, I have not complete this function, but, at the next time, I will push it.
Second, I have separate code into different file.Each file's code's function is writed in the top of file.I hope this will help everyone to more easy to
understand the project.

Today, I start to perfect the "detail situation" label.I want to add ToolBar and TopMenu to it.First of all, I need to leant how to use them.So it may be a long time to see I complete it.
To be honest, perfecting the "detail dynamics" is more important.If I come across too many problems in learnning use the two Controls, I may first do this.

I have distinguish different process in the listview.So you can look these process's run time that have the same name.
Next time, I will perfect the "detail dynamics" labe.I will make it can show the recent monitor process run time situation in it.
Meanwhile, I may adjust the "detail situation" label, but I don't have a specific idea about it.So you can have a expect about it.
